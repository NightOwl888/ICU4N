# The following is the list of URLs where ICU4J can be downloaded. For redundency, we allow
# multiple download locations for different Maven mirrors. Use {0} to replace the
# major version number and {1} to replace the minor version number. The build will fill these
# in automatically.
#
# The file will be downloaded to _artifacts/, but only if the file doesn't already exist there.
# This allows users to remove resources from the original release and rebuild the satellite assemblies
# without them. Alternatively, the data can be rebuilt using the ICU Data Build Tool and packed into a .jar
# file that can be put into the _artifacts/ folder. However do note that the application should be tested
# thoroughly if doing so as pointed out in: https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/icu_data/buildtool.html
